    <h2>Network your way into your next position</h2>
    <p>Use your connections, both past and present to network your into your next position.  While speaking with them, whather it be during a Marketing Meeting or a casual conversation, be sure to ask them who else you should speak with. </p>

    <h2>Design your brand</h2>
    <p> Ensure your brand matches.  When designing your Marketing Sheet, Linked IN profile, resume, etc, ensure that you are sending out the same message.
